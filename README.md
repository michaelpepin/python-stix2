# python-stix2
+ To provide an R&D space for generating STIX 2.0.0 compliant json output and json consumption
  + Work is based on OASIS STIX 2.0.0-rc.3 


#### Notes:
+ This code is currently under development and is not "runnable", however to goal is to make it so.
+ I am currently the only developer on this project, however in few cases when code used from other source it is explicitly stated by whom and where it was sourced.
    + I am certainly willing consider others, who are interested in working on this project.
